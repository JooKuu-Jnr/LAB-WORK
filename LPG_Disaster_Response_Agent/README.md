## Current Progress

- `lab1`: Environment and SPADE platform setup completed.
- `lab2`: Perception agent and simulated LPG station environment.
- `lab3`: Finite-state-machine agent driving emergency logic.
- `lab4`: (new) Multi-agent communication using FIPA-ACL performatives.

Each lab builds on the previous ones; lab4 demonstrates coordination between
sensor, coordinator and response agents using INFORM/REQUEST messages.
